          <h1 class="page-title">CHELSEA FC 2010'S ERA</h1>
          <p>
            The players who formed the backbone of Chelsea greatest side for the best part of a decade would manage one or two spectacular last hurrahs before departing. Chief among these were Didier Drogba, who signed off with the equalising goal and winning penalty on the greatest night in the club's history: the Champions League final in Munich, and not far behind, Frank Lampard, skipper in that 2012 final and again, a year later, in the Europa League final triumph over Benfica - a few months after he had eclipsed Bobby Tambling as the highest goalscorer for Chelsea.</p>

            <p>The Londoners had now become only the fourth club to win every available UEFA competition, and the first from England. The fact these victories were achieved with different managers - Roberto Di Matteo, who also steered the Blues to FA Cup glory, and Rafael Benitez - revealed a different story, though, of underachievement in the Premier League. Eager to compete for top-flight honours again, the board arranged a stunning return for Jose Mourinho: 'I am one of you,' he told ecstatic Chelsea fans. Despite undertaking a radical overhaul of the team, his impact was immediate, with a near miss in the title race and a semi-final exit in the Champions League. There were farewells for Lampard, David Luiz, Juan Mata and other favourites, but with the Portuguese navigator back at the helm the course towards further honours looks assured.</p>

            <p>Mourinho quickly identified the areas most in need of reinforcement and the club wasted little time in ensuring the players were signed.</p>

            <p>Two from Spain – Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas – were the headline buys and Thibaut Courtois began his Chelsea career in earnest after a long loan in the same country. He quickly became first-choice goalkeeper.
